#### How to prevent deletion of important documents indefinitely using Amazon S3 Glacier Vault

1. Set a legal hold on the formulation document archive in the vault
2. Use vault lock policy to match the LegalHold tag and deny deletion of the formulation document archive

Vault Lock Policy: Provides a way to lock the vault's policy for a specified period or indefinitely, preventing changes to the policy after it is locked.

Legal Hold: Typically used in litigation or investigation scenarios where data needs to be preserved until the hold is removed. This would prevent deletion while the hold is in place.


#### How to deny all accounts in AWS org from creating an S3 bucket with public access

Enable Amazon S3 block public access on AWS org's service control policies(SCPs) to deny users making change to these settings

- SCPs (Service control policies) assist in centrally controlling permissions for all accounts in AWS Organizations. This helps to ensure that all the accounts in AWS Organizations are following the same access guidelines.
- Amazon S3 Block Public Access settings can be used to manage public access to Amazon S3 buckets. By default, all the new buckets created in Amazon S3 do not support public access. But users can change these settings to allow public access to the bucket.
- Block Public Access settings can be used to deny permission to users from making changes to public access to the bucket.
- SCP can be applied at the Organization Root-level to deny all accounts permission to make S3 buckets public.
